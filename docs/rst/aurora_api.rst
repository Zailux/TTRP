NDI Aurora API
==============

This is an inofficial implementation for the NDI Aurora System.
For other NDI systems it is possible to use the C++ implementation https://github.com/PlusToolkit/ndicapi.
The main reason for this API is that the ndicapi was not available for python at the time and unknown at the
beginning of the project.

HINT not all commands and errors are implemented yet.
